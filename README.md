Currenty Heat looks for any messages with a medal.tv clip in them,
	and uploads them to discord.

It is recommended to use a venv to run this project:

```
python3 -m venv
source bin/activate
# or if you're on windows
# ./bin/activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Once you want to run the bot it is a simple
python3 main.py
```
